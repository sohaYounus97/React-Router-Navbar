     <h4>Quick Start</h4>
     <p>You’ll need a React web app to add react-router.If you need to create one, the easiest way
      to get started is with a popular tool called Create React App.First install create-react-app,
      if you don’t already have it, and then make a new project with it. example: npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app demo-app
cd demo-app</p>
<br/>
      	<h4>Installation</h4>
     <p>React Router DOM is published to npm so you can install it with either npm or yarn.For npm used: npm install react-router-dom
     npm.</p>
