  <h4>REACT ROUTER</h4>
<p>Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. 
  React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with
  your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a 
  composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever
   React is rendering--so take your pick!</p>
